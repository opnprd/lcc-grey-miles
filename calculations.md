# Cost Calculations
Some notes to explain how costs have been calculated, as there is varying figures and it may be unclear.

## Pool Vehicle
- **£3.71** per hour (rounded up to nearest hour) for hire
- **£0.18** per mile for fuel

## Car Club
We have taken the best case scenario and assumed that:
- Vehicle is an EV
- Vehicle's annual mileage is 7500 miles

Costs are:
- **£19700** vehicle cost over 7 years
- **£1285** maintainance costs annually
- **£0.04** electricity costs per mile

Average cost = **£0.587 per mile**

## Taxi
Always rounding up to the nearest mile:
- **£3.50** base charge for first mile
- **£1.60** per additional mile

## Self Drive
As this tool is meant to discourage using personal vehicles, we will take the worst-case scenario and assume that:
- The driver is a casual car user
- The driver has done less than 10k miles so is recieving the higher mileage rate
- Miles will be rounded up

This gives a cost of **£0.45** per mile.
